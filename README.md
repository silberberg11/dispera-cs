- 👋 Hi, I’m @silberberg11
- 👀 I have a deep interest in Network Security, Physical Cybersecurity and Risk Management.
- 📍 Based in Sydney, Australia

## About Me
At 16, I’m building projects that merge cybersecurity, cognitive science, and engineering.  
My goal is to understand how humans and systems can be hacked — and protected.

## 📚 Past Projects
- **USB Rubber Ducky Clone:** Built from a Raspberry Pi Pico, programmed to execute automated keystroke injection attacks for penetration testing.
- **ESP8266 Phishing:** Created phishing simulation sites and credential capture pages to demonstrate wireless network security flaws.
- **Malware Obfuscation:** Developed a polymorphic Python-based code obfuscation tool at age 14, using dynamic variable generation, layered encoding (Base64, zlib), and `marshal` to evade static signature detection.

## 🔥 Future Builds
- **Laser Microphone:** Designed and simulated a physical side-channel attack by capturing and analyzing sound vibrations from surfaces (e.g., windows) using laser reflection, demonstrating the vulnerabilities of acoustic signals in secure environments.
- **Blog Website:** Going to upload my projects as a form of blogs!! Stay tuned.
- **AI Powered Education Tools:** I plan on developing AI tools for the use of education.
- more soon!

  ## 🌌 Fun Facts
- 🥋 Competing BJJ blue belt and NSW State Champion
- I'm like cognitive science & how humans make bad decisions, alongside my deep passion for Network Security.
- I like exploring deep advanced Mathematics concepts aswell as chemistry
